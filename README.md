## Built With

**Backend**  
- Java 21
- Spring Boot 
- Spring Security + JWT

- Maven  
- PostgreSQL  
- Hibernate (JPA)  
- ModelMapper  
- Constructor-based Dependency Injection  

**Frontend**  
- React  
- TypeScript  
- Bootstrap 5  
- Vite  
- Axios  
- React Router  

**Deployment / Infrastructure**  
- Proxmox VE (hypervisor)  
- Ubuntu Server (container VM)  
- Docker + Docker Compose

- Cloudflare Tunnel (secure public access)

## Test Coverage

> Test coverage pending integration with testing frameworks and CI tools (e.g., JUnit + JaCoCo).

## Configuration Highlights

- üîê `SecurityConfig.java`: Stateless JWT authentication with fine-grained endpoint access
- üîÑ `MapperConfig.java`: Central ModelMapper bean with custom field skips
- üìÑ `WebConfig.java`: CORS config for frontend (default: `https://coffeetica.eu`) + file resource handler
- ‚öôÔ∏è `DataInitializer.java`: Injects default roles and a SuperAdmin account on startup
- üìÅ `FileHelper.java`: Simple utility for deleting uploaded files

## Challenges during development

- Architecting the full-stack application structure from scratch
- Implementing JWT-based authentication and role-based access control
- Designing and planning the **visual side of the app (UI/UX)** to ensure consistency and usability
- Coding the entire frontend application in React with TypeScript
- Deploying the app using Proxmox, Docker, and Cloudflare Tunnel without prior DevOps experience with local hosting

## How to Run Locally

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jbytow/coffeetica.git
cd coffeetica
```

### 2. Setup Environment Variables

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both `coffeetica/` and `coffeetica-frontend/` folders.
- Adjust the values according to your local configuration.

### 3. Update `docker-compose.yml` for local development

Modify the `volumes:` section of the `backend` service to mount the correct local path:

```yaml
backend:
  ...
  volumes:
    # - ./uploads:/uploads            # Use this in production/server
    - ./coffeetica-backend/uploads:/uploads  # Use this locally
```

Additionally, in the `frontend` service, update the build arguments for local API/image URLs:

```yaml
frontend:
  ...
  build:
    context: ./coffeetica-frontend
    args:
      - VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/api
      - VITE_IMAGE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080/uploads/
```

### 4. Enable local resource serving in `WebConfig.java`

In `WebConfig.java`, uncomment the following block to allow serving uploaded files locally:

```java
@Override
public void addResourceHandlers(ResourceHandlerRegistry registry) {
    registry.addResourceHandler("/uploads/**")
            .addResourceLocations("file:/uploads/");
}
```

> ‚òùÔ∏è In production, static files are served via NGINX, so this block should be **disabled on server**.

---

### 5. Run the app

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

- Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  
- Backend: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)  
- Uploaded images (locally): [http://localhost:8080/uploads/roasteries/example.png](http://localhost:8080/uploads/roasteries/example.png)
